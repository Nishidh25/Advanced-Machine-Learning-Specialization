        "In this assignment, you will learn how to use neural networks to solve sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. Seq2Seq models are very popular these days because they achieve great results in Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Conversational Modeling and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using sequence-to-sequence modeling you are going to build a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions, by taking an equation as an input to the neural network and producing an answer as it's output.\n",

        "The resulting solution for this problem will be based on state-of-the-art approaches for sequence-to-sequence learning and you should be able to easily adapt it to solve other tasks. However, if you want to train your own machine translation system or intellectual chat bot, it would be useful to have access to compute resources like GPU, and be patient, because training of such systems is usually time consuming. \n",

        " - To share all parameters during training and inference, we use one scope and set the flag 'reuse' to True at inference time. You might be interested to know more about how [variable scopes](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables) work in TF. \n",
        " - To create the decoder itself, we will use [BasicDecoder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BasicDecoder) class. As previously, you should choose some RNN cell, e.g. GRU cell. To turn hidden states into logits, we will need a projection layer. One of the simple solutions is using [OutputProjectionWrapper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/rnn/OutputProjectionWrapper).\n",
        " - For getting the predictions, it will be convinient to use [dynamic_decode](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/dynamic_decode). This function uses the provided decoder to perform decoding."
